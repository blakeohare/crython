# Crython
Crython is a subset of Python, in particular, it is the intersection of features of Python and [Crayon](https://github.com/blakeohare/crayon). Crython is translated into both Python and Crayon. This is useful if you know Python but would like to leverage the platform support of Crayon (JavaScript, C#, Java).
